Sentiment Analysis and Visualisation: Build a machine learning-powered sentiment analysis tool to perform real-time sentiment analysis on social media posts, news articles, and other text-based data sources. Use streamlit to create a custom dashboard that displays the results of the analysis in real-time, and AWS to deploy the tool and store the data in an S3 bucket. Visualize the data using interactive charts and graphs to enable better insights.\n\n3. Real-Time Fraud Detection: Build a real-time fraud detection system that uses machine learning to flag fraudulent transactions as they happen, and sends alerts to the appropriate parties in real-time. Use streamlit to create a custom dashboard that displays the analysis results, AWS for deployment, and a scalable data warehouse like Amazon Redshift to store the data.\n\n4. Data Analysis and Reporting Tool: Build a data analysis and reporting tool using Streamlit to help companies monitor their performance and create reports based on their data. Use AWS to deploy the tool and store the data in a scalable data warehouse like Amazon Redshift or Amazon S3 to enable easy access and analysis.\n\n5. Predictive Analytics Dashboard: Build a predictive analytics dashboard using streamlit and Python to help businesses make better decisions based on real-time data streams. Use machine learning models to predict trends, identify patterns, and forecast future outcomes.
